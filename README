Java game for finals. 

IDE: BlueJay

Designed a 16 bit java game. Wrote a level editor to translate a photo pixel by pixel, into a level, in which the player then can spawn in.
The inspiration for the game is similar to a Pokemon mini game, where the player needs to traverse on ice to escape a maze.
